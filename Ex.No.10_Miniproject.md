### DATE: 21/10/2025                                                                          
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222240045
### AIM: 
To develop a game Hurdle Jumper in Unity 
### Algorithm:
```
Player.cs
1. Initialize SpriteRenderer component.
2. Start sprite animation loop every 0.15 seconds.
3. On enabling the player:
      a. Reset vertical position to 0.
      b. Reset movement direction to zero.
4. Every frame (Update):
      a. If space key or left mouse button pressed, set upward movement direction.
      b. Apply gravity to the vertical direction.
      c. Update player position based on direction.
      d. Tilt the player based on vertical movement speed.
5. Animate player sprite by cycling through sprite frames.
6. On collision with:
      a. Obstacle tag → trigger game over.
      b. Scoring tag → increase score.
```
```
GameManager.cs
1. On awake:
    a. Ensure singleton instance of the game manager.
2. On start:
    a. Pause the game (stop time, disable player controls).
3. Pause() method:
    a. Set game time scale to 0 (freeze game).
    b. Disable player controls.
4. Play() method:
    a. Reset score to zero and update UI.
    b. Hide play button and game over UI.
    c. Enable player controls and start game (set time scale to 1).
    d. Find all existing pipes and destroy them to reset obstacles.
5. GameOver() method:
    a. Show play button and game over UI.
    b. Pause the game.
6. IncreaseScore() method:
      a. Increment score and update UI.
```
```
HurdleSpawner.cs
1.Initialize required variables such as hurdle prefab, spawn rate, Y-range, and movement speed.
2.Start the hurdle spawning coroutine when the game begins.
3.Inside the coroutine loop:
    a. Wait for the given spawnRate duration.
    b. Instantiate a new hurdle at the spawner’s current position.
    c. Generate a random Y-position between minY and maxY and apply it to the hurdle.
4.Assign leftward movement to the hurdle using Rigidbody2D linear velocity.
5.Destroy the spawned hurdle after 10 seconds to avoid unnecessary buildup.
6.Continue the loop indefinitely to keep spawning hurdles.
